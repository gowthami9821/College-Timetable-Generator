#SLOTIFY - College Timetable Generator
This project is a web-based application designed to help students and faculty efficiently generate a conflict-free weekly timetable. Users can input details such as course name, instructor ID, lecturer name, room number, number of lectures per week, and the class type (theory or lab). Once all courses are added, the system intelligently generates a visual timetable that avoids conflicts in instructor schedules, room availability, and time slots. Each course's schedule is clearly displayed, and users can delete or modify course entries as needed before generating the timetable. Future enhancements may include adding faculty free-time availability, export options (PDF/Excel), and support for multiple sections. SLOTIFY provides a simple, user-friendly interface for academic scheduling and aims to simplify the complex process of manual timetable creation.
